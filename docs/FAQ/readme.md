## Why TypeScript over Javascript?
JavaScript is dynamically typed, so type differences (e.g. using Number instead of String) throw error on runtime. It may be convenient for developing quickly, but as the codebase grows larger, dynamic typing result in numerous unexpected errors.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed version of JavaScript, offering static typing among many other benefits. We can define types, enums, and interfaces, and enforce variables or functions to adhere to those types. Major React applications use TypeScript (.ts and .tsx) to ease coding and collaboration for countless developers.

So TypeScript is strongly typed, Object-oriented, and supported by a strong, mature community. It also compiles to JavaScript automatically and is compatiable with JavaScript files (.js and .jsx). Plus, it has an amazing [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)!
